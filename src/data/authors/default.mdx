As a web developer, my passion lies in creating animations and small websites using the latest web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Jekyll, React.js and Vue.js. I have experience in using PHP and am currently learning about WordPress. I am constantly learning new skills through online courses such as e-learning and MOOCs to stay up to date with the latest developments in programming languages, web interfaces, artificial intelligence, and semantic web.

I consider myself a self-taught individual with a desire to stay informed about new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy taking and editing photographs and am currently interested in video production. My passion for web development extends to graphic design where I have designed posters, business cards, and posters for non-profit organizations.

I welcome feedback and useful links to continue learning and staying current in the fields of web development, photography, and connected objects.
