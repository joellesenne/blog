The MacBook Air M2 is a powerful device that can be used for a variety of tasks, including web development. However, in order to get the most out of this device, it is important to properly configure it for efficient web development. In this article, we will go over some of the key steps that you should take to configure your MacBook Air M2 for web development.

## Step 1: Install the latest operating system

The first step in configuring your MacBook Air M2 for web development is to make sure that you have the latest operating system installed.
This will ensure that you have access to all the latest features and bug fixes that are necessary for web development.
But first, you have to configure two or three things
To view the system profiler on the command line, open the Terminal application (you can find this by searching for it in Spotlight or by going to "Applications/Utilities").
Once the Terminal is open, type in "system_profiler SPHardwareDataType" (without the quotes) and press enter.

```shell
# View system profiler
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
```

To view hidden files on a Mac, you can use the Terminal application. Open the Terminal application by searching for it in Spotlight or by going to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

```shell
# View hidden files on Mac
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles true
killall Finder
```

Now hidden files will be visible in Finder. To hide hidden files again, repeat steps 1–3 but replace “TRUE” with “FALSE” in step 2.

Alternatively, you can use a third-party application such as "Hidden Files" to easily toggle the visibility of hidden files.
And create a `.dotfiles` folder for the configuration of the working environment.

```shell
# Create folder dotfiles & filemanes config environment
mkdir .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
touch .<filenames> # .zshrc, .aliases .gitconfig...

# how Symlink your dotfiles
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.<filenames>  ~/.<filenames>

# where Symlink  the dotfiles directory
ls -l ~/.<filenames>
```

## Step 2: Install the latest Xcode
Xcode is the development environment that is used to create iOS and macOS apps. It is an essential tool for web developers and should be installed on your MacBook Air M2.
Installing Xcode Command Line Tools is a simple process, and it's necessary for certain development tasks on a Mac. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Terminal application. You can find it in the Applications > Utilities folder or by searching for it in Spotlight.
2. Type the following command and press Enter: `xcode-select --install`
3. A pop-up window will appear asking if you want to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click "Install" to begin the installation process.
4. The installation process will take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, you'll see a message that says "The software was installed".
5. You can confirm that the Xcode Command Line Tools have been installed by running the command `xcode-select -p`. If the command returns a path, then the installation was successful.
6. The Xcode Command Line Tools are now installed and ready for use. You can use them to perform various development tasks, such as building and debugging iOS and macOS applications, as well as other tasks such as Git version control.

```shell
# Before installing Homebrew, we need to install the CLI tools for Xcode
xcode-select --install
```

It's important to note that you need an internet connection to install the Xcode Command Line Tools, and that you need to accept the license agreement to proceed. Once you have them installed, you're ready to start your web development projects on your MacBook Air M2 with efficient tools.

## Step 3: Install the latest version of Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install and manage software. This is a useful tool for web developers as it allows you to easily install web development tools like Node.js, Ruby and more.

```shell
# Install HomeBrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Depending on the version of HomeBrew, the process for installing a package varies. For HomeBrew version 2.7 and above, you use the command “brew install --cask package” to install the package. For HomeBrew version 2.5 and 2.6, you use “brew install package” and for HomeBrew version 2.4 and below, you use “brew cask install package”.

```shell
# HomeBrew v 2.7 and above
brew install --cask <package>

# HomeBrew v 2.5 and 2.6
brew install <package>

# HomeBrew v 2.4 and below
brew cask install <package>

# Run brew
brew help
```

Create file brew.sh in `.dotfiles`.

```shell
# Touch file
cd .dotfiles
touch brew.sh
```

My installation Formula :

```shell
# Brew install formula
brew install volta git mas zsh exa tree z gotop broot imagemagick task fd openssl httpd
```

My installation APP :

```shell
# Brew install App
brew install --cask iterm2 brave-browser google-chrome firefox opera orion google-drive dropbox alfred caffeine rectangle alt-tab pomodone monitorcontrol visual-studio-code jetbrains-toolbox docker gitkraken figma obsidian notion spotify jumpcut postman rambox warp slack sidenotes latest parsify fig discord responsively
```

Bonus :

```shell
# Brew install fonts
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-fira-code

# New install chatGPT
brew tap lencx/chatgpt https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT.git
brew install --cask chatgpt --no-quarantine
```

This code is used to remove old versions of packages from a computer's local repository of software packages, such as Homebrew in this case. It helps ensure that only the latest and most secure versions of the software packages are installed.

```shell
# Remove outdated versions from the cellar.
brew cleanup
```

## Step 4: Install Volta Node.js and PNPM
Volta is a JavaScript tool chain manager that makes it easy to manage multiple versions of JavaScript tools and their dependencies, such as Node.js, NPM, and yarn, on the same machine. With Volta, you can switch between different versions of Node.js and other tools on-the-fly, making it easier to work on multiple projects that require different versions of the same tools.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. It allows you to build server-side applications using JavaScript and numerous libraries and modules that are available through NPM, the Node.js package manager.
Install and use Volta:

```shell
# Install Volta
brew install volta

# setup volta
volta setup

# volta install <package>
volta install node
volta install pnpm
```

Volta install React and Gatsby package:

```shell
# volta install <package>
volta install gatsby-cli
volta install react-scripts
```

## Step 5: Install a code editor

A code editor is an essential tool for web development and should be installed on your MacBook Air M2. Some popular code editors include Atom, Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.

Use brew install cask `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`

## Step 6: Install a web browser

A web browser is necessary for web development and should be installed on your MacBook Air M2. Some popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

Use brew install cask `brew install --cask <package>`

## Step 7: Install a version control system

A version control system is used to track changes made to your code and is an essential tool for web development. Some popular version control systems include Git, Mercurial and Subversion.

Use brew install formula `brew install git`

```shell
# Config Git
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email [johndoe@example.com](johndoe@example.com)

# Edit .gitconfig
nano .gitconfig
```

## Step 8: Install a local development server

A local development server is used to test your code on your MacBook Air M2. Some popular local development servers include MAMP, XAMPP and WAMP.

## Step 9: Install a debugging tool

A debugging tool is used to find and fix errors in your code and should be installed on your MacBook Air M2. Some popular debugging tools include Firebug, Chrome DevTools and Safari Web Inspector.

## Step 10: Install a task runner

A task runner is used to automate common tasks in web development and should be installed on your MacBook Air M2. Some popular task runners include Grunt, Gulp and Webpack.

By following these steps, you will be able to configure your MacBook Air M2 for efficient web development. Make sure to keep your software and tools up to date and to always backup your work. Happy coding!
