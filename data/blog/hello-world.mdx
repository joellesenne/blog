# Hello world

> My name is Joël Lesenne, I am a freelance web developer in Lyon

I am passionate about web development, I like to make animations in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with the latest Web tools, I like to make small sites with Jekyll, React.js or Vue.js, I had the opportunity to use the PHP language on a particular site and I learn about WordPress to write these few lines.

I am of online courses called e-learning or Moocs on the site [Fun Mooc](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/) and [OpenClassRoom](https://openclassrooms.com/)  to learn new things (programming language, objects connect, web interface, artificial intelligence, semantic web, etc.) to obtain certificates and make it my new profession in the framework of a professional reconversion.

I like to write code and graphical user interfaces building. Not only that, but I consider myself as a man self-taught with the aim to learn and stay informed on new technologies.

In my free time, I like to take pictures, I like to develop my pictures, give them a look and currently, I am interested in video. In short, I am passionate about image and graphic design where I have designed posters, business cards and posters for non-profits.

On the site, I would like to have some feedback with useful links that can often help and learn more about the world of the web, photography and connected objects of tomorrow.

Take a look at my [website](https://joellesenne.dev/), my [CV](https://cv.joellesenne.dev/), my [lab](https://lab.joellesenne.dev/) and my [photograpies](https://photos.joellesenne.dev/) for the pleasure of your eyes.
